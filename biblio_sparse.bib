@article{Perrinet12pred,
	Abstract = {In low-level sensory systems, it is still unclear how the noisy information collected locally by neurons may give rise to a coherent global percept. This is well demonstrated for the detection of motion in the aperture problem: as luminance of an elongated line is symmetrical along its axis, tangential velocity is ambiguous when measured locally. Here, we develop the hypothesis that motion-based predictive coding is sufficient to infer global motion. Our implementation is based on a context-dependent diffusion of a probabilistic representation of motion. We observe in simulations a progressive solution to the aperture problem similar to physio-logy and behavior. We demonstrate that this solution is the result of two underlying mechanisms. First, we demonstrate the formation of a tracking behavior favoring temporally coherent features independent of their texture. Second, we observe that incoherent features are explained away, while coherent information diffuses progressively to the global scale. Most previous models included ad hoc mechanisms such as end-stopped cells or a selection layer to track specific luminance-based features as necessary conditions to solve the aperture problem. Here, we have proved that motion-based predictive coding, as it is implemented in this functional model, is sufficient to solve the aperture problem. This solution may give insights into the role of prediction underlying a large class of sensory computations.},

@article{Babadi14,
	Abstract = {In several sensory pathways, input stimuli project to sparsely active downstream populations that have more neurons than incoming axons. Here, we address the computational benefits of expansion and sparseness for clustered inputs, where different clusters represent behaviorally distinct stimuli and intracluster variability represents sensory or neuronal noise. Through analytical calculations and numerical simulations, we show that expansion implemented by feed-forward random synaptic weights amplifies variability in the incoming stimuli, and this noise enhancement increases with sparseness of the expanded representation. In addition, the low dimensionality of the input layer generates overlaps between the induced representations of different stimuli, limiting the benefit of expansion. Highly sparse expansive representations obtained through synapses that encode the clustered structure of the input reduce both intrastimulus variability and the excess overlaps between stimuli, enhancing the ability of downstream neurons to perform classification and recognition tasks. Implications for olfactory, cerebellar, and visual processing are discussed.},

                Figures in which human observers perceive "illusory contours" were found to evoke responses in cells of area 18 in the visual cortex of alert monkeys. The cells responded as if the contours were formed by real lines or edges. Modifications that weakened the perception of contours also reduced the neuronal responses. In contrast, cells in area 17 were apparently unable to "see" these contours.

@article{PerrinetAdamsFriston14,
	Abstract = {This paper considers the problem of sensorimotor delays in the optimal control of (smooth) eye movements under uncertainty. Specifically, we consider delays in the visuo-oculomotor loop and their implications for active inference. Active inference uses a generalisation of Kalman filtering to provide Bayes optimal estimates of hidden states and action in generalised coordinates of motion. Representing hidden states in generalised coordinates provides a simple way of compensating for both sensory and oculomotor delays. The efficacy of this scheme is illustrated using neuronal simulations of pursuit initiation responses, with and without compensation. We then consider an extension of the generative model to simulate smooth pursuit eye movements---in which the visuo-oculomotor system believes both the target and its centre of gaze are attracted to a (hidden) point moving in the visual field. Finally, the generative model is equipped with a hierarchical structure, so that it can recognise and remember unseen (occluded) trajectories and emit anticipatory responses. These simulations speak to a straightforward and neurobiologically plausible solution to the generic problem of integrating information from different sources with different temporal delays and the particular difficulties encountered when a system---like the oculomotor system---tries to control its environment with delayed signals.},

@article{Bolz89,
	Abstract = {The cells in the primary visual cortex possess numerous functional properties that are more complex and varied than those seen in the cortical input. These properties result from the network of intrinsic cortical connections running across the cortical layers and between cortical columns. In the current study we relate the long receptive fields that are characteristic of layer 6 cells to the input that these cells receive from layer 5. The axons of layer 5 pyramidal cells project over long distances within layer 6, enabling layer 6 cells to collect input from regions of cortex representing large parts of the visual field. When layer 5 was locally inactivated by injection of the inhibitory transmitter {GABA}, layer 6 cells lost sensitivity over the portion of their receptive fields corresponding to the inactivated region of layer 5. This suggests that the extensive convergence in the projection from layer 5 to layer 6 is responsible for generating the long receptive fields characteristic of the layer 6 cells.},

	Abstract = {The sigmoidal tuning curve that maximizes the mutual information for a Poisson neuron, or population of Poisson neurons, is obtained. The optimal tuning curve is found to have a discrete structure that results in a quantization of the input signal. The number of quantization levels undergoes a hierarchy of phase transitions as the length of the coding window is varied. We postulate, using the mammalian auditory system as an example, that the presence of a subpopulation structure within a neural population is consistent with an optimal neural code.},

Over- complete expansions are often desirable, as they are better models of the image-generation process. Such expansions lead to the use of sparse codes. However, minimizing the number of non-zero coefficients of linear expansions is an unsolved problem. In this article, a generative-model framework is used to analyze the requirements, the difficulty, and current approaches to sparse image coding.},

We present a theoretical analysis for 1- and {2-D} cases and characterize the optimal linear encoder and decoder in the mean-squared error sense. Our analysis allows for an arbitrary number of coding units, thus including both under- and over-complete representations, and provides insights into optimal coding strategies. In particular, we show how the form of the code adapts to the number of coding units and to different data and noise conditions in order to achieve robustness. We also present numerical solutions of robust coding for high-dimensional image data, demonstrating that these codes are substantially more robust than other linear image coding methods such as {PCA}, {ICA}, and wavelets.},

	Abstract = {Computational models of primary visual cortex have demonstrated that principles of efficient coding and neuronal sparseness can explain the emergence of neurones with localised oriented receptive fields. Yet, existing models have failed to predict the diverse shapes of receptive fields that occur in nature. The existing models used a particular "soft" form of sparseness that limits average neuronal activity. Here we study models of efficient coding in a broader context by comparing soft and "hard" forms of neuronal sparseness. As a result of our analyses, we propose a novel network model for visual cortex. The model forms efficient visual representations in which the number of active neurones, rather than mean neuronal activity, is limited. This form of hard sparseness also economises cortical resources like synaptic memory and metabolic energy. Furthermore, our model accurately predicts the distribution of receptive field shapes found in the primary visual cortex of cat and monkey.},

@article{Hubel68,
	Abstract = {1. The striate cortex was studied in lightly anaesthetized macaque and spider monkeys by recording extracellularly from single units and stimulating the retinas with spots or patterns of light. Most cells can be categorized as simple, complex, or hypercomplex, with response properties very similar to those previously described in the cat. On the average, however, receptive fields are smaller, and there is a greater sensitivity to changes in stimulus orientation. A small proportion of the cells are colour coded.2. Evidence is presented for at least two independent systems of columns extending vertically from surface to white matter. Columns of the first type contain cells with common receptive-field orientations. They are similar to the orientation columns described in the cat, but are probably smaller in cross-sectional area. In the second system cells are aggregated into columns according to eye preference. The ocular dominance columns are larger than the orientation columns, and the two sets of boundaries seem to be independent.3. There is a tendency for cells to be grouped according to symmetry of responses to movement; in some regions the cells respond equally well to the two opposite directions of movement of a line, but other regions contain a mixture of cells favouring one direction and cells favouring the other.4. A horizontal organization corresponding to the cortical layering can also be discerned. The upper layers ({II} and the upper two-thirds of {III}) contain complex and hypercomplex cells, but simple cells are virtually absent. The cells are mostly binocularly driven. Simple cells are found deep in layer {III}, and in {IV} A and {IV} B. In layer {IV} B they form a large proportion of the population, whereas complex cells are rare. In layers {IV} A and {IV} B one finds units lacking orientation specificity; it is not clear whether these are cell bodies or axons of geniculate cells. In layer {IV} most cells are driven by one eye only; this layer consists of a mosaic with cells of some regions responding to one eye only, those of other regions responding to the other eye. Layers V and {VI} contain mostly complex and hypercomplex cells, binocularly driven.5. The cortex is seen as a system organized vertically and horizontally in entirely different ways. In the vertical system (in which cells lying along a vertical line in the cortex have common features) stimulus dimensions such as retinal position, line orientation, ocular dominance, and perhaps directionality of movement, are mapped in sets of superimposed but independent mosaics. The horizontal system segregates cells in layers by hierarchical orders, the lowest orders (simple cells monocularly driven) located in and near layer {IV}, the higher orders in the upper and lower layers.},

@article{Dumoulin14,
	Abstract = {Neurons in the visual cortex process a local region of visual space, but in order to adequately analyze natural images, neurons need to interact. The notion of an  '' association field'' proposes that neurons interact to extract extended contours. Here, we identify the site and properties of contour integration mechanisms. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) and population receptive field ({pRF}) analyses. We devised {pRF} mapping stimuli consisting of contours. We isolated the contribution of contour integration mechanisms to the {pRF} by manipulating the contour content. This stimulus manipulation led to systematic changes in {pRF} size. Whereas a bank of Gabor filters quantitatively explains {pRF} size changes in V1, only {V2/V3} {pRF} sizes match the predictions of the association field. {pRF} size changes in later visual field maps, {hV4}, {LO}-1, and {LO}-2 do not follow either prediction and are probably driven by distinct classical receptive field properties or other extraclassical integration mechanisms. These {pRF} changes do not follow conventional {fMRI} signal strength measures. Therefore, analyses of {pRF} changes provide a novel computational neuroimaging approach to investigating neural interactions. We interpreted these results as evidence for neural interactions along co-oriented, cocircular receptive fields in the early extrastriate visual cortex ({V2/V3}), consistent with the notion of a contour association field.},

	Abstract = {Neurons are often assumed to operate in a highly unreliable manner: a neuron can signal the same stimulus with a variable number of action potentials. However, much of the experimental evidence supporting this view was obtained in the visual cortex. We have, therefore, assessed trial-to-trial variability in the auditory cortex of the rat. To ensure single-unit isolation, we used cell-attached recording. Tone-evoked responses were usually transient, often consisting of, on average, only a single spike per stimulus. Surprisingly, the majority of responses were not just transient, but were also binary, consisting of 0 or 1 action potentials, but not more, in response to each stimulus; several dramatic examples consisted of exactly one spike on 100\% of trials, with no trial-to-trial variability in spike count. The variability of such binary responses differs from comparably transient responses recorded in visual cortical areas such as area {MT}, and represent the lowest trial-to-trial variability mathematically possible for responses of a given firing rate. Our study thus establishes for the first time that transient responses in auditory cortex can be described as a binary process, rather than as a highly variable Poisson process. These results demonstrate that cortical architecture can support a more precise control of spike number than was previously recognized, and they suggest a re-evaluation of models of cortical processing that assume noisiness to be an inevitable feature of cortical codes.},

	Abstract = {The L0-norm constraint in sparse coding has the advantage of producing the same diversity of receptive field shapes as physiology data, but is difficult for analysis. It remains a challenging issue to understand how the diverse shapes of V1 simple cell receptive fields emerge in visual cortex. This paper presents a biologically plausible learning algorithm, named Hebbian-based mean shift, for this problem. The L0-norm constraint optimizes the number of basis functions rather than their coefficients. We report that the optimization procedure is essentially a 0--1 programming of the selection of basis functions. By assuming that the basis functions are independently selected from a basis set, we find the spatial distribution of input samples containing a special basis function has a star shape and peaks at this basis function. Thus, learning the basis functions for sparse coding with the L0-norm can be interpreted as mode detection where the basis functions are the modes of the kernel density estimate. We employ mean shift to detect modes and prove that the updating rule for the mean shift is Hebbian. The simulation results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm in producing both Gabor-like and blob-like basis functions.},

@article{Li08,
	Abstract = {In complex visual scenes, linking related contour elements is important for object recognition. This process, thought to be stimulus driven and hard wired, has substrates in primary visual cortex (V1). Here, however, we find contour integration in V1 to depend strongly on perceptual learning and top-down influences that are specific to contour detection. In naive monkeys, the information about contours embedded in complex backgrounds is absent in V1 neuronal responses and is independent of the locus of spatial attention. Training animals to find embedded contours induces strong contour-related responses specific to the trained retinotopic region. These responses are most robust when animals perform the contour detection task but disappear under anesthesia. Our findings suggest that top-down influences dynamically adapt neural circuits according to specific perceptual tasks. This may serve as a general neuronal mechanism of perceptual learning and reflect top-down mediated changes in cortical states.},

@article{McManus11,
	Abstract = {The ability to derive meaning from complex sensory input requires the integration of information over space and time, as well as cognitive mechanisms to shape that integration. We studied these processes in the primary visual cortex (V1), where neurons are thought to integrate visual inputs along contours defined by an association field ({AF}). We recorded extracellularly from single cells in macaque V1 to map the {AF}, by using an optimization algorithm to find the contours that maximally activated individual cells. We combined the algorithm with a delayed-match-to-sample task, to test how the optimal contours might be molded by the monkey's expectation for particular cue shapes. We found that V1 neurons were selective for complex shapes, a property previously ascribed to higher cortical areas. Furthermore, the shape selectivity was reprogrammed by perceptual task: Over the whole network, the optimal modes of geometric selectivity shifted between distinct subsets of the {AF}, alternately representing different stimulus features known to predominate in natural scenes. Our results suggest a general model of cortical function, whereby horizontal connections provide a broad domain of potential associations, and top--down inputs dynamically gate these linkages to task switch the function of a network.},

	Abstract = {Abstract--- {M}eanwhile biorthogonal wavelets got a very popu- lar image processing tool, alternative multiresolution transforms have been proposed for solving some of their drawbacks, namely the poor selectivity in orientation and the lack of translation in- variance due to the aliasing between subbands. {T}hese transforms are generally overcomplete and consequently offer huge degrees of freedom in their design. {A}t the same time their optimization get a challenging task. {W}e proposed here a log-{G}abor wavelet transform gathering the excellent mathematical properties of the {G}abor functions with a carefully construction to maintain the properties of the filters and to permit exact reconstruction. {T}wo major improvements are proposed: first the highest frequency bands are covered by narrowly localized oriented filters. {A}nd second, all the frequency bands including the highest and lowest frequencies are uniformly covered so as exact reconstruction is achieved using the same filters in both the direct and the inverse transforms (which means that the transform is self-invertible). {T}he transform is optimized not only mathematically but it also follows as much as possible the knowledge on the receptive field of the simple cells of the {P}rimary {V}isual {C}ortex ({V}1) of primates and on the statistics of natural images. {C}ompared to the state of the art, the log-{G}abor wavelets show excellent behavior in their ability to segregate the image information (e.g. the contrast edges) from incoherent {G}aussian noise by hard thresholding and to code the image features through a reduced set of coefficients with large magnitude. {S}uch characteristics make the transform a promising tool for general image processing tasks.},

	Abstract = {Representing signals as linear combinations of basis vectors sparsely selected from an overcomplete dictionary has proven to be advantageous for many applications in pattern recognition, machine learning, signal processing, and computer vision. While this approach was originally inspired by insights into cortical information processing, biologically plausible approaches have been limited to exploring the functionality of early sensory processing in the brain, while more practical applications have employed non-biologically plausible sparse coding algorithms. Here, a biologically plausible algorithm is proposed that can be applied to practical problems. This algorithm is evaluated using standard benchmark tasks in the domain of pattern classification, and its performance is compared to a wide range of alternative algorithms that are widely used in signal and image processing. The results show that for the classification tasks performed here, the proposed method is competitive with the best of the alternative algorithms that have been evaluated. This demonstrates that classification using sparse representations can be performed in a neurally plausible manner, and hence, that this mechanism of classification might be exploited by the brain.},

The aim of the paper is to show the advantages of using such a modeling in order to develop efficient and fast bio-inspired modules for low level image processing. At the retina level, a spatio-temporal filtering ensures accurate structuring of video data (noise and illumination variation removal, static and dynamic contour enhancement). In the V1 cortex, a frequency and orientation based analysis is performed. The combined use of retina and V1 cortex modeling allows the development of low level image processing modules for contour enhancement, for moving contour extraction, for motion analysis and for motion event detection. Each module is described and its performances are evaluated. The retina model has been integrated into a real-time {C/C}++ optimized program which is also presented in this paper with the derived computer vision tools.},

Among the cost functions we examine are approximate l(p) norms (0 ≤ p ≤ 2), modified l(p)-norms, block-l1 norms, and reweighted algorithms.

To probabilistically enhance noisy and low contrast curve images (e.g., edge and line operator responses), we combine this curvature process with the curve indicator random field, which is a prior for ideal curve images. In particular, we provide an expression for a nonlinear, minimum mean square error filter that requires the solution of two elliptic partial differential equations. Initial computations are reported, highlighting how the filter is curvature-selective, even when curvature is absent in the input.},

@article{Cotter99,
	Abstract = {The problem of signal representation in terms of basis vectors from a large, over-complete, spanning dictionary has been the focus of much research. Achieving a succinct, or `sparse', representation is known as the problem of best basis representation. Methods are considered which seek to solve this problem by sequentially building up a basis set for the signal. Three distinct algorithm types have appeared in the literature which are here termed basic matching pursuit ({BMP}), order recursive matching pursuit ({ORMP}) and modified matching pursuit ({MMP}). The algorithms are first described and then their computation is closely examined. Modifications are made to each of the procedures which improve their computational efficiency. The complexity of each algorithm is considered in two contexts; one where the dictionary is variable (time-dependent) and the other where the dictionary is fixed (time-independent). Experimental results are presented which demonstrate that the {ORMP} method is the best procedure in terms of its ability to give the most compact signal representation, followed by {MMP} and then {BMP} which gives the poorest results. Finally, weighing the performance of each algorithm, its computational complexity and the type of dictionary available, recommendations are made as to which algorithm should be used for a given problem},

	Abstract = {The advent of unbiased recording and imaging techniques to evaluate firing activity across neocortical neurons has revealed substantial heterogeneity in response properties in vivo, and that a minority of neurons are responsible for the majority of spikes. Despite the computational advantages to sparsely firing populations, experimental data defining the fraction of responsive neurons and the range of firing rates have not been synthesized. Here we review data about the distribution of activity across neuronal populations in primary sensory cortex. Overall, the firing output of granular and infragranular layers is highest. Although subthreshold activity across supragranular neurons is decidedly non-sparse, spikes are much less frequent and some cells are silent. Superficial layers of the cortex may employ specific cell and circuit mechanisms to increase sparseness.},

@article{Hunt13,
	Abstract = {Receptive fields acquired through unsupervised learning of sparse representations of natural scenes have similar properties to primary visual cortex (V1) simple cell receptive fields. However, what drives in vivo development of receptive fields remains controversial. The strongest evidence for the importance of sensory experience in visual development comes from receptive field changes in animals reared with abnormal visual input. However, most sparse coding accounts have considered only normal visual input and the development of monocular receptive fields. Here, we applied three sparse coding models to binocular receptive field development across six abnormal rearing conditions. In every condition, the changes in receptive field properties previously observed experimentally were matched to a similar and highly faithful degree by all the models, suggesting that early sensory development can indeed be understood in terms of an impetus towards sparsity. As previously predicted in the literature, we found that asymmetries in inter-ocular correlation across orientations lead to orientation-specific binocular receptive fields. Finally we used our models to design a novel stimulus that, if present during rearing, is predicted by the sparsity principle to lead robustly to radically abnormal receptive fields. The responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1), a region of the brain involved in encoding visual input, are modified by the visual experience of the animal during development. For example, most neurons in animals reared viewing stripes of a particular orientation only respond to the orientation that the animal experienced. The responses of V1 cells in normal animals are similar to responses that simple optimisation algorithms can learn when trained on images. However, whether the similarity between these algorithms and V1 responses is merely coincidental has been unclear. Here, we used the results of a number of experiments where animals were reared with modified visual experience to test the explanatory power of three related optimisation algorithms. We did this by filtering the images for the algorithms in ways that mimicked the visual experience of the animals. This allowed us to show that the changes in V1 responses in experiment were consistent with the algorithms. This is evidence that the precepts of the algorithms, notably sparsity, can be used to understand the development of V1 responses. Further, we used our model to propose a novel rearing condition which we expect to have a dramatic effect on development.},

@article{King13,
	Abstract = {Sparse coding models of natural scenes can account for several physiological properties of primary visual cortex (V1), including the shapes of simple cell receptive fields ({RFs}) and the highly kurtotic firing rates of V1 neurons. Current spiking network models of pattern learning and sparse coding require direct inhibitory connections between the excitatory simple cells, in conflict with the physiological distinction between excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory ({GABAergic}) neurons (Dale's Law). At the same time, the computational role of inhibitory neurons in cortical microcircuit function has yet to be fully explained. Here we show that adding a separate population of inhibitory neurons to a spiking model of V1 provides conformance to Dale's Law, proposes a computational role for at least one class of interneurons, and accounts for certain observed physiological properties in V1. When trained on natural images, this excitatory--inhibitory spiking circuit learns a sparse code with Gabor-like {RFs} as found in V1 using only local synaptic plasticity rules. The inhibitory neurons enable sparse code formation by suppressing predictable spikes, which actively decorrelates the excitatory population. The model predicts that only a small number of inhibitory cells is required relative to excitatory cells and that excitatory and inhibitory input should be correlated, in agreement with experimental findings in visual cortex. We also introduce a novel local learning rule that measures stimulus-dependent correlations between neurons to support '' explaining away'' mechanisms in neural coding.},

@article{Sincich01,
	Abstract = {One important aspect of the functional architecture of primary visual cortex is the circuitry that accounts for the receptive field properties of neurons. The anatomy that underlies retinotopy and ocular dominance is well known, but no anatomical structure related to orientation selectivity has been found in primates. We examined whether the arrangement of local axon systems projecting within the cortical layers might be correlated with orientation preference in New World monkeys. We found that axons in layer 3 spread out from the site of a tracer injection in an anisotropic manner and that this elongated distribution is aligned with the preferred orientation recorded at each site. Moreover, within a few degrees of the foveal representation, the majority of the axon terminals fall within or just outside of the limits of the cortical mapping of the classical receptive field. Thus local axons produce a field of monosynaptic excitation that aligns with orientation axes and reaches neurons that have receptive fields which are adjacent in visual space.},

	Abstract = {If modern computers are sometimes superior to cognition in some specialized tasks such as playing chess or browsing a large database, they can't beat the efficiency of biological vision for such simple tasks as recognizing a relative or following an object in a complex background. We present in this paper our attempt at outlining the dynamical, parallel and event-based representation for vision in the architecture of the central nervous system. We will illustrate this by showing that in a signal matching framework, a {L/LN} (linear/non-linear) cascade may efficiently transform a sensory signal into a neural spiking signal and we apply this framework to a model retina. However, this code gets redundant when using an over-complete basis as is necessary for modeling the primary visual cortex: we therefore optimize the efficiency cost by increasing the sparseness of the code. This is implemented by propagating and canceling redundant information using lateral interactions. We compare the efficiency of this representation in terms of compression as the reconstruction quality as a function of the coding length. This will correspond to a modification of the Matching Pursuit algorithm where the {ArgMax} function is optimized for competition, or Competition Optimized Matching Pursuit ({COMP}). We will particularly focus on bridging neuroscience and image processing and on the advantages of such an interdisciplinary approach.},

Here, in addition to describing this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the neurobiological implications of sparse coding. Of particular interest is the case when the code is overcomplete---i.e., when the number of code elements is greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space.

@article{Willmore11,
	Abstract = {Theoretical studies of mammalian cortex argue that efficient neural codes should be sparse. However, theoretical and experimental studies have used different definitions of the term "sparse" leading to three assumptions about the nature of sparse codes. First, codes that have high lifetime sparseness require few action potentials. Second, lifetime-sparse codes are also population-sparse. Third, neural codes are optimized to maximize lifetime sparseness. Here, we examine these assumptions in detail and test their validity in primate visual cortex. We show that lifetime and population sparseness are not necessarily correlated and that a code may have high lifetime sparseness regardless of how many action potentials it uses. We measure lifetime sparseness during presentation of natural images in three areas of macaque visual cortex, V1, V2, and V4. We find that lifetime sparseness does not increase across the visual hierarchy. This suggests that the neural code is not simply optimized to maximize lifetime sparseness. We also find that firing rates during a challenging visual task are higher than theoretical values based on metabolic limits and that responses in V1, V2, and V4 are well-described by exponential distributions. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that neurons are optimized to maximize information transmission subject to metabolic constraints on mean firing rate.},

@article{Blattler11,
	Abstract = {To what extent are sensory responses in the brain compatible with first-order principles? The efficient coding hypothesis projects that neurons use as few spikes as possible to faithfully represent natural stimuli. However, many sparsely firing neurons in higher brain areas seem to violate this hypothesis in that they respond more to familiar stimuli than to nonfamiliar stimuli. We reconcile this discrepancy by showing that efficient sensory responses give rise to stimulus selectivity that depends on the stimulus-independent firing threshold and the balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs. We construct a cost function that enforces minimal firing rates in model neurons by linearly punishing suprathreshold synaptic currents. By contrast, subthreshold currents are punished quadratically, which allows us to optimally reconstruct sensory inputs from elicited responses. We train synaptic currents on many renditions of a particular bird's own song ({BOS}) and few renditions of conspecific birds' songs ({CONs}). During training, model neurons develop a response selectivity with complex dependence on the firing threshold. At low thresholds, they fire densely and prefer {CON} and the reverse {BOS} ({REV}) over {BOS}. However, at high thresholds or when hyperpolarized, they fire sparsely and prefer {BOS} over {REV} and over {CON}. Based on this selectivity reversal, our model suggests that preference for a highly familiar stimulus corresponds to a high-threshold or strong-inhibition regime of an efficient coding strategy. Our findings apply to songbird mirror neurons, and in general, they suggest that the brain may be endowed with simple mechanisms to rapidly change selectivity of neural responses to focus sensory processing on either familiar or nonfamiliar stimuli. In summary, we find support for the efficient coding hypothesis and provide new insights into the interplay between the sparsity and selectivity of neural responses.},

In particular, it plagues our ability to acquire, process, and model high-dimensional data sets. Moreover, neural systems must cope with the challenge of processing data in high dimensions to learn and operate successfully within a complex world. We review recent mathematical advances that provide ways to combat dimensionality in specific situations. These advances shed light on two dual questions in neuroscience. First, how can we as neuroscientists rapidly acquire high-dimensional data from the brain and subsequently extract meaningful models from limited amounts of these data? And second, how do brains themselves process information in their intrinsically high-dimensional patterns of neural activity as well as learn meaningful, generalizable models of the external world from limited experience?},

@article{Friston12,
	Abstract = {If perception corresponds to hypothesis testing (Gregory, 1980); then visual searches might be construed as experiments that generate sensory data. In this work, we explore the idea that saccadic eye movements are optimal experiments, in which data are gathered to test hypotheses or beliefs about how those data are caused. This provides a plausible model of visual search that can be motivated from the basic principles of self-organized behavior: namely, the imperative to minimize the entropy of hidden states of the world and their sensory consequences. This imperative is met if agents sample hidden states of the world efficiently. This efficient sampling of salient information can be derived in a fairly straightforward way, using approximate Bayesian inference and variational free-energy minimization. Simulations of the resulting active inference scheme reproduce sequential eye movements that are reminiscent of empirically observed saccades and provide some counterintuitive insights into the way that sensory evidence is accumulated or assimilated into beliefs about the world.},

	Abstract = {Research progress in machine vision has been very significant in recent years. Robust face detection and identification algorithms are already readily available to consumers, and modern computer vision algorithms for generic object recognition are now coping with the richness and complexity of natural visual scenes. Unlike early vision models of object recognition that emphasized the role of figure-ground segmentation and spatial information between parts, recent successful approaches are based on the computation of loose collections of image features without prior segmentation or any explicit encoding of spatial relations. While these models remain simplistic models of visual processing, they suggest that, in principle, bottom-up activation of a loose collection of image features could support the rapid recognition of natural object categories and provide an initial coarse visual representation before more complex visual routines and attentional mechanisms take place. Focusing on biologically plausible computational models of (bottom-up) pre-attentive visual recognition, we review some of the key visual features that have been described in the literature. We discuss the consistency of these feature-based representations with classical theories from visual psychology and test their ability to account for human performance on a rapid object categorization task.},

The level of performance of their visual system and its robustness to image degradations still surpasses the best computer vision systems despite decades of engineering effort. In particular, the high accuracy of primates in ultra rapid object categorization and rapid serial visual presentation tasks is remarkable. Given the number of processing stages involved and typical neural latencies, such rapid visual processing is likely to be mostly feedforward. Here we show that a specific implementation of a class of feedforward theories of object recognition (that extend the Hubel and Wiesel simple-to-complex cell hierarchy and account for many anatomical and physiological constraints) can predict the level and the pattern of performance achieved by humans on a rapid masked animal vs. non-animal categorization task.},

@article{Bosking97,
	Abstract = {Horizontal connections, formed primarily by the axon collaterals of pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of visual cortex, extend for millimeters parallel to the cortical surface and form patchy terminations. Previous studies have provided evidence that the patches formed by horizontal connections exhibit modular specificity, preferentially linking columns of neurons with similar response characteristics, such as preferred orientation. The issue of how these connections are distributed with respect to the topographic map of visual space, however, has not been resolved. Here we combine optical imaging of intrinsic signals with small extracellular injections of biocytin to assess quantitatively the specificity of horizontal connections with respect to both the map of orientation preference and the map of visual space in tree shrew V1. Our results indicate that horizontal connections outside a radius of 500 μm from the injection site exhibit not only modular specificity, but also specificity for axis of projection. Labeled axons extend for longer distances, and give off more terminal boutons, along an axis in the map of visual space that corresponds to the preferred orientation of the injection site. Inside of 500 μm, the pattern of connections is much less specific, with boutons found along every axis, contacting sites with a wide range of preferred orientations. The system of long-range horizontal connections can be summarized as preferentially linking neurons with co-oriented, co-axially aligned receptive fields. These observations suggest specific ways that horizontal circuits contribute to the response properties of layer 2/3 neurons and to mechanisms of visual perception.},

	Abstract = {This paper studies the properties of L1-analysis regularization for the resolution of linear inverse problems. Most previous works consider sparse synthesis priors where the sparsity is measured as the L1 norm of the coefficients that synthesize the signal in a given dictionary. In contrast, the more general analysis regularization minimizes the L1 norm of the correlations between the signal and the atoms in the dictionary. The corresponding variational problem includes several well-known regularizations such as the discrete total variation and the fused lasso. We give a sufficient condition to ensure that a signal is the unique solution of the analysis regularization when there is no noise in the observations. The same criterion ensures the robustness of the sparse analysis solution to a small noise in the observations. We also define a stronger sufficient condition that ensures robustness to an arbitrary bounded noise. In the special case of synthesis regularization, our contributions recover already known results, that are hence generalized to the analysis setting. We illustrate these theoritical results on practical examples to study the robustness of the total variation and the fused lasso regularizations.},

We show that Motion Clouds correspond to dense mixing of localized moving gratings with random positions. Their global envelope is similar to natural-like stimulation with an approximate full-field translation corresponding to a retinal slip. We describe the construction of these stimuli mathematically and propose an open-source Python-based implementation. Examples of the use of this framework are shown.

@article{Cadieu11,
	Abstract = {We present a model of intermediate-level visual representation that is based on learning invariances from movies of the natural environment. The model is composed of two stages of processing: an early feature representation layer and a second layer in which invariances are explicitly represented. Invariances are learned as the result of factoring apart the temporally stable and dynamic components embedded in the early feature representation. The structure contained in these components is made explicit in the activities of second-layer units that capture invariances in both form and motion. When trained on natural movies, the first layer produces a factorization, or separation, of image content into a temporally persistent part representing local edge structure and a dynamic part representing local motion structure, consistent with known response properties in early visual cortex (area V1). This factorization linearizes statistical dependencies among the first-layer units, making them learnable by the second layer. The second-layer units are split into two populations according to the factorization in the first layer. The form-selective units receive their input from the temporally persistent part (local edge structure) and after training result in a diverse set of higher-order shape features consisting of extended contours, multiscale edges, textures, and texture boundaries. The motion-selective units receive their input from the dynamic part (local motion structure) and after training result in a representation of image translation over different spatial scales and directions, in addition to more complex deformations. These representations provide a rich description of dynamic natural images and testable hypotheses regarding intermediate-level representation in visual cortex.},

	Abstract = {Oriented edges in images of natural scenes tend to be aligned in collinear or co-circular arrangements, with lines and smooth curves more common than other possible arrangements of edges (Geisler et al., Vis Res 41:711-24, 2001). The visual system appears to take advantage of this prior information, and human contour detection and grouping performance is well predicted by such an "association field" (Field et al., Vis Res 33:173-93, 1993). One possible candidate substrate for implementing an association field in mammals is the set of long-range lateral connections between neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1), which could act to facilitate detection of contours matching the association field, and/or inhibit detection of other contours (Choe and Miikkulainen, Biol Cyb 90:75-88, 2004). To fill this role, the lateral connections would need to be orientation specific and aligned along contours, and indeed such an arrangement has been found in tree shrew primary visual cortex (Bosking et al., J Neurosci 17:2112-27, 1997). However, it is not yet known whether these patterns develop as a result of visual experience, or are simply hard-wired to be appropriate for the statistics of natural scenes. To investigate this issue, we examined the properties of the visual environment of laboratory animals, to determine whether the observed connection patterns are more similar to the statistics of the rearing environment or of a natural habitat. Specifically, we analyzed the cooccurence statistics of edge elements in images of natural scenes, and compared them to corresponding statistics for images taken from within the rearing environment of the animals in the Bosking et al. (1997) study. We used a modified version of the algorithm from Geisler et al. (2001), with a more general edge extraction algorithm that uses sparse coding to avoid multiple responses to a single edge. Collinearity and co-circularity results for natural images replicated qualitatively the results from Geisler et al. (2001), confirming that prior information about continuations appeared consistently in natural images. However, we find that the largely man-made environment in which these animals were reared has a significantly higher probability of collinear edge elements. We thus predict that if the lateral connection patterns are due to visual experience, the patterns in wild-raised tree shrews would be very different from those measured by Bosking et al. (1997), with shorter-range correlations and less emphasis on collinear continuations. This prediction can be tested in future experiments on matching groups of animals reared in different environments. {W.H}. Bosking and Y. Zhang and B. Schofield and D.

@article{Peharz12,
	Abstract = {Although nonnegative matrix factorization ({NMF}) favors a sparse and part-based representation of nonnegative data, there is no guarantee for this behavior. Several authors proposed {NMF} methods which enforce sparseness by constraining or penalizing the \^{a}1-norm of the factor matrices. On the other hand, little work has been done using a more natural sparseness measure, the \^{a}0-pseudo-norm. In this paper, we propose a framework for approximate {NMF} which constrains the \^{a}0-norm of the basis matrix, or the coefficient matrix, respectively. For this purpose, techniques for unconstrained {NMF} can be easily incorporated, such as multiplicative update rules, or the alternating nonnegative least-squares scheme. In experiments we demonstrate the benefits of our methods, which compare to, or outperform existing approaches.},

@article{Hunt09,
	Abstract = {Visual activity after eye-opening influences feature map structure in primary visual cortex (V1). For instance, rearing cats in an environment of stripes of one orientation yields an over-representation of that orientation in V1. However, whether such changes also affect the higher-order statistics of orientation maps is unknown. A statistical bias of orientation maps in normally raised animals is that the probability of the angular difference in orientation preference between each pair of points in the cortex depends on the angle of the line joining those points relative to a fixed but arbitrary set of axes. Natural images show an analogous statistical bias; however, whether this drives the development of comparable structure in V1 is unknown. We examined these statistics for normal, stripe-reared and dark-reared cats, and found that the biases present were not consistently related to those present in the input, or to genetic relationships. We compared these results with two computational models of orientation map development, an analytical model and a Hebbian model. The analytical model failed to reproduce the experimentally observed statistics. In the Hebbian model, while orientation difference statistics could be strongly driven by the input, statistics similar to those seen in experimental maps arose only when symmetry breaking was allowed to occur spontaneously. These results suggest that these statistical biases of orientation maps arise primarily spontaneously, rather than being governed by either input statistics or genetic mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {To understand how the human visual system analyzes images, it is essential to know the structure of the visual environment. In particular, natural images display consistent statistical properties that distinguish them from random luminance distributions. We have studied the geometric regularities of oriented elements (edges or line segments) present in an ensemble of visual scenes, asking how much information the presence of a segment in a particular location of the visual scene carries about the presence of a second segment at different relative positions and orientations. We observed strong long-range correlations in the distribution of oriented segments that extend over the whole visual field. We further show that a very simple geometric rule, cocircularity, predicts the arrangement of segments in natural scenes, and that different geometrical arrangements show relevant differences in their scaling properties. Our results show similarities to geometric features of previous physiological and psychophysical studies. We discuss the implications of these findings for theories of early vision.},

@article{Hunt11,
	Abstract = {The statistical structure of the visual world offers many useful clues for understanding how biological visual systems may understand natural scenes. One particularly important early process in visual object recognition is that of grouping together edges which belong to the same contour. The layout of edges in natural scenes have strong statistical structure. One such statistical property is that edges tend to lie on a common circle, and this 'co-circularity' can predict human performance at contour grouping. We therefore tested the hypothesis that long-range excitatory lateral connections in the primary visual cortex, which are believed to be involved in contour grouping, display a similar co-circular structure. By analyzing data from tree shrews, where information on both lateral connectivity and the overall structure of the orientation map was available, we found a surprising diversity in the relevant statistical structure of the connections. In particular, the extent to which co-circularity was displayed varied significantly. Overall, these data suggest the intriguing possibility that V1 may contain both co-circular and anti-cocircular connections.},

@article{Spratling11,
	Abstract = {Cross-orientation suppression and surround suppression have been extensively studied in primary visual cortex (V1). These two forms of suppression have some distinct properties which has led to the suggestion that they are generated by different underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, it has been suggested that mechanisms other than intracortical inhibition may be central to both forms of suppression. A simple computational model ({PC}/{BC}), in which intracortical inhibition is fundamental, is shown to simulate the distinct properties of cross-orientation and surround suppression. The same model has previously been shown to account for a large range of V1 response properties including orientation-tuning, spatial and temporal frequency tuning, facilitation and inhibition by flankers and textured surrounds as well as a range of other experimental results on cross-orientation suppression and surround suppression. The current results thus provide additional support for the {PC}/{BC} model of V1 and for the proposal that the diverse range of response properties observed in V1 neurons have a single computational explanation. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that current neurophysiological evidence is insufficient to discount intracortical inhibition as a central mechanism underlying both forms of suppression.

	Abstract = {This paper studies the properties of L1-analysis regularization for the resolution of linear inverse problems. Most previous works consider sparse synthesis priors where the sparsity is measured as the L1 norm of the coefficients that synthesize the signal in a given dictionary. In contrast, the more general analysis regularization minimizes the L1 norm of the correlations between the signal and the atoms in the dictionary. The corresponding variational problem includes several well-known regularizations such as the discrete total variation and the fused lasso. We first prove that a solution of analysis regularization is a piecewise affine function of the observations. Similarly, it is a piecewise affine function of the regularization parameter. This allows us to compute the degrees of freedom associated to sparse analysis estimators. Another contribution gives a sufficient condition to ensure that a signal is the unique solution of the analysis regularization when there is no noise in the observations. The same criterion ensures the robustness of the sparse analysis solution to a small noise in the observations. Our last contribution defines a stronger sufficient condition that ensures robustness to an arbitrary bounded noise. In the special case of synthesis regularization, our contributions recover already known results, that are hence generalized to the analysis setting. We illustrate these theoritical results on practical examples to study the robustness of the total variation and the fused lasso regularizations.},

	Abstract = {The Gestalt law of "good continuation" has been used to describe a variety of phenomena demonstrating the importance of continuity in human perception. In this study, we consider how continuity may be represented by a visual system that filters spatial data using arrays of cells selective for orientation and spatial frequency. Many structures (e.g. fractal contours) show a form of redundancy which is well represented by the continuity of features as they vary across space and frequency. We suggest that it is possible to take advantage of the redundancy in continuous, but non-aligned features by associating the outputs of filters with similar tuning. Five experiments were performed, to determine the rules that govern the perception of continuity. Observers were presented with arrays of oriented, band-pass elements (Gabor patches) in which a subset of the elements was aligned along a "jagged" path. Using a forced-choice procedure, observers were found to be capable of identifying the path within a field of randomly-oriented elements even when the spacing between the elements was considerably larger than the size of any of the individual elements. Furthermore, when the elements were oriented at angles up to +/- 60 deg relative to one another, the path was reliably identified. Alignment of the elements along the path was found to play a large role in the ability to detect the path. Small variations in the alignment or aligning the elements orthogonally (i.e. "side-to-side" as opposed to "end-to-end") significantly reduced the observer's ability to detect the presence of a path. The results are discussed in terms of an "association field" which integrates information across neighboring filters tuned to similar orientations. We suggest that some of the processes involved in texture segregation may have a similar explanation.},

	Abstract = {Sparse coding algorithms trained on natural images can accurately predict the features that excite visual cortical neurons, but it is not known whether such codes can be learned using biologically realistic plasticity rules. We have developed a biophysically motivated spiking network, relying solely on synaptically local information, that can predict the full diversity of V1 simple cell receptive field shapes when trained on natural images. This represents the first demonstration that sparse coding principles, operating within the constraints imposed by cortical architecture, can successfully reproduce these receptive fields. We further prove, mathematically, that sparseness and decorrelation are the key ingredients that allow for synaptically local plasticity rules to optimize a cooperative, linear generative image model formed by the neural representation. Finally, we discuss several interesting emergent properties of our network, with the intent of bridging the gap between theoretical and experimental studies of visual cortex. In a sparse coding model, individual input stimuli are represented by the activities of model neurons, the majority of which are inactive in response to any particular stimulus. For a given class of stimuli, the neurons are optimized so that the stimuli can be faithfully represented with the minimum number of co-active units. This has been proposed as a model for visual cortex. While it has previously been demonstrated that sparse coding model neurons, when trained on natural images, learn to represent the same features as do neurons in primate visual cortex, it remains to be demonstrated that this can be achieved with physiologically realistic plasticity rules. In particular, learning in cortex appears to occur by the modification of synaptic connections between neurons, which must depend only on information available locally, at the synapse, and not, for example, on the properties of large numbers of distant cells. We provide the first demonstration that synaptically local plasticity rules are sufficient to learn a sparse image code, and to account for the observed response properties of visual cortical neurons: visual cortex actually could learn a sparse image code.},

@article{Girshick11,
	Abstract = {Humans are good at performing visual tasks, but experimental measurements have revealed substantial biases in the perception of basic visual attributes. An appealing hypothesis is that these biases arise through a process of statistical inference, in which information from noisy measurements is fused with a probabilistic model of the environment. However, such inference is optimal only if the observer's internal model matches the environment. We found this to be the case. We measured performance in an orientation-estimation task and found that orientation judgments were more accurate at cardinal (horizontal and vertical) orientations. Judgments made under conditions of uncertainty were strongly biased toward cardinal orientations. We estimated observers' internal models for orientation and found that they matched the local orientation distribution measured in photographs. In addition, we determined how a neural population could embed probabilistic information responsible for such biases.},

	Abstract = {Recently, statistical techniques have been used to assist art historians in the analysis of works of art. We present a novel technique for the quantification of artistic style that utilizes a sparse coding model. Originally developed in vision research, sparse coding models can be trained to represent any image space by maximizing the kurtosis of a representation of an arbitrarily selected image from that space. We apply such an analysis to successfully distinguish a set of authentic drawings by Pieter Bruegel the Elder from another set of well-known Bruegel imitations. We show that our approach, which involves a direct comparison based on a single relevant statistic, offers a natural and potentially more germane alternative to wavelet-based classification techniques that rely on more complicated statistical frameworks. Specifically, we show that our model provides a method capable of discriminating between authentic and imitation Bruegel drawings that numerically outperforms well-known existing approaches. Finally, we discuss the applications and constraints of our technique.},

	Abstract = {Several studies have shown that the information conveyed by bell-shaped tuning curves increases as their width decreases, leading to the notion that sharpening of tuning curves improves population codes. This notion, however, is based on assumptions that the noise distribution is independent among neurons and independent of the tuning curve width. Here we reexamine these assumptions in networks of spiking neurons by using orientation selectivity as an example. We compare two principal classes of model: one in which the tuning curves are sharpened through cortical lateral interactions, and one in which they are not. We report that sharpening through lateral interactions does not improve population codes but, on the contrary, leads to a severe loss of information. In addition, the sharpening models generate complicated codes that rely extensively on pairwise correlations. Our study generates several experimental predictions that can be used to distinguish between these two classes of model.},

@article{Field99,
	Abstract = {The processing of spatial information by the visual system shows a number of similarities to the wavelet transforms that have become popular in applied mathematics. Over the last decade, a range of studies have focused on the question of 'why' the visual system would evolve this strategy of coding spatial information. One such approach has focused on the relationship between the visual code and the statistics of natural scenes under the assumption that the visual system has evolved this strategy as a means of optimizing the representation of its visual environment. This paper reviews some of this literature and looks at some of the statistical properties of natural scenes that allow this code to be efficient. It is argued that such wavelet codes are efficient because they increase the independence of the vectors' outputs (i.e. they increase the independence of the responses of the visual neurons) by finding the sparse structure available in the input. Studies with neural networks that attempt to maximize the 'sparsity' of the representation have been shown to produce vectors (neural receptive fields) that have many of the properties of a wavelet representation. It is argued that the visual environment has the appropriate sparse structure to make this sparse output possible. It is argued that these sparse/independent representations make it computationally easier to detect and represent the higher--order structure present in complex environmental data.},

@article{Daugman80,
	Abstract = {Most vision research embracing the spatial frequency paradigm has been conceptually and mathematically a one-dimensional analysis of two-dimensional mechanisms. Spatial vision models and the experiments sustaining them have generally treated spatial frequency as a one-dimensional variable, even though receptive fields and retinal images are two-dimensional and linear transform theory obliges any frequency analysis to preserve dimension. Four models of cortical receptive fields are introduced and studied here in {2D} form, in order to illustrate the relationship between their excitatory/inhibitory spatial structure and their resulting {2D} spectral properties. It emerges that only a very special analytic class of receptive fields possess independent tuning functions for spatial frequency and orientation; namely, those profiles whose two-dimensional Fourier Transforms are expressible as the separable product of a radial function and an angular function. Furthermore, only such receptive fields would have the same orientation tuning curve for single bars as for gratings. All classes lacking this property would describe cells responsive to different orientations for different spatial frequencies and vice versa; this is shown to be the case, for example, for the Hubel \& Wiesel model of cortical orientation-tuned simple cells receiving inputs from an aligned row of center/surround {LGN} cells. When these results are considered in conjunction with psychophysical evidence for nonseparability of spatial frequency and orientation tuning properties within a '' channel'', it becomes mandatory that future spatial vision research of the Fourier genre take on an explicitly two-dimensional character.},

We may understand this response as an ideal observer in a probabilistic framework by using Bayesian theory [Weiss, Y., Simoncelli, {E.P}., Adelson, {E.H}., 2002. Motion illusions as optimal percepts. Nature Neuroscience, 5(6), 598-604, doi:10.1038/nn858] which we previously proved to be successfully adapted to model the {OFR} for different levels of noise with full field gratings. More recent experiments of {OFR} have used disk gratings and bipartite stimuli which are optimized to study the dynamics of center-surround integration. We quantified two main characteristics of the spatial integration of motion: (i) a finite optimal stimulus size for driving {OFR}, surrounded by an antagonistic modulation and (ii) a direction selective suppressive effect of the surround on the contrast gain control of the central stimuli [Barth\'{e}lemy, {F.V}., Vanzetta, I., Masson, {G.S}., 2006. Behavioral receptive field for ocular following in humans: dynamics of spatial summation and center-surround interactions. Journal of Neurophysiology, (95), 3712-3726, doi:10.1152/jn.00112.2006]. Herein, we extended the ideal observer model to simulate the spatial integration of the different local motion cues within a probabilistic representation. We present analytical results which show that the hypothesis of independence of local measures can describe the spatial integration of the motion signal. Within this framework, we successfully accounted for the contrast gain control mechanisms observed in the behavioral data for center-surround stimuli. However, another inhibitory mechanism had to be added to account for suppressive effects of the surround.},

	Abstract = {Theoretical studies suggest that primary visual cortex (area V1) uses a sparse code to efficiently represent natural scenes. This issue was investigated by recording from V1 neurons in awake behaving macaques during both free viewing of natural scenes and conditions simulating natural vision. Stimulation of the nonclassical receptive field increases the selectivity and sparseness of individual V1 neurons, increases the sparseness of the population response distribution, and strongly decorrelates the responses of neuron pairs. These effects are due to both excitatory and suppressive modulation of the classical receptive field by the nonclassical receptive field and do not depend critically on the spatiotemporal structure of the stimuli. During natural vision, the classical and nonclassical receptive fields function together to form a sparse representation of the visual world. This sparse code may be computationally efficient for both early vision and higher visual processing.},

	Abstract = {A number of recent attempts have been made to describe early sensory coding in terms of a general information processing strategy. In this paper, two strategies are contrasted. Both strategies take advantage of the redundancy in the environment to produce more effective representations. The first is described as a ?compact? coding scheme. A compact code performs a transform that allows the input to be represented with a reduced number of vectors (cells) with minimal {RMS} error. This approach has recently become popular in the neural network literature and is related to a process called Principal Components Analysis ({PCA}). A number of recent papers have suggested that the optimal ?compact? code for representing natural scenes will have units with receptive field profiles much like those found in the retina and primary visual cortex. However, in this paper, it is proposed that compact coding schemes are insufficient to account for the receptive field properties of cells in the mammalian visual pathway. In contrast, it is proposed that the visual system is near to optimal in representing natural scenes only if optimality is defined in terms of ?sparse distributed? coding. In a sparse distributed code, all cells in the code have an equal response probability across the class of images but have a low response probability for any single image. In such a code, the dimensionality is not reduced. Rather, the redundancy of the input is transformed into the redundancy of the firing pattern of cells. It is proposed that the signature for a sparse code is found in the fourth moment of the response distribution (i.e., the kurtosis). In measurements with 55 calibrated natural scenes, the kurtosis was found to peak when the bandwidths of the visual code matched those of cells in the mammalian visual cortex. Codes resembling ?wavelet transforms? are proposed to be effective because the response histograms of such codes are sparse (i.e., show high kurtosis) when presented with natural scenes. It is proposed that the structure of the image that allows sparse coding is found in the phase spectrum of the image. It is suggested that natural scenes, to a first approximation, can be considered as a sum of self-similar local functions (the inverse of a wavelet).

@article{Samonds06,
	Abstract = {We explored how contour information in primary visual cortex might be embedded in the simultaneous activity of multiple cells recorded with a 100-electrode array. Synchronous activity in cat visual cortex was more selective and predictable in discriminating between drifting grating and concentric ring stimuli than changes in firing rate. Synchrony was found even between cells with wholly different orientation preferences when their receptive fields were circularly aligned, and membership in synchronous groups was orientation and curvature dependent. The existence of synchrony between cocircular cells reinforces its role as a general mechanism for contour integration and shape detection as predicted by association field concepts. Our data suggest that cortical synchrony results from common and synchronous input from earlier visual areas and that it could serve to shape extrastriate response selectivity.},

	Abstract = {An approach is described for curve inference that is based on curvature information. The inference procedure is divided into two stages: a trace inference stage, which is the subject of the present work, and a curve synthesis stage. It is shown that recovery of the trace of a curve requires estimating local models for the curve at the same time, and that tangent and curvature information are sufficient. These make it possible to specify powerful constraints between estimated tangents to a curve, in terms of a neighborhood relationship called cocircularity, and between curvature estimates, in terms of a curvature consistency relation. Because all curve information is quantized, special care must be taken to obtain accurate estimates of trace points, tangents, and curvatures. This issue is addressed specifically to the introduction of a smoothness constraint and a maximum curvature constraint. The procedure is applied to two types of images: artificial images designed to evaluate curvature and noise sensitivity, and natural images},

A subset of neurons responsible for carrying the residual errors showed endstopping and other extra-classical receptive-field effects. These results suggest that rather than being exclusively feedforward phenomena, nonclassical surround effects in the visual cortex may also result from cortico-cortical feedback as a consequence of the visual system using an efficient hierarchical strategy for encoding natural images.},

It is unclear how this sensitivity of cortical networks to small perturbations comes about and whether it is a generic property of cortex.

Furthermore, it is believed that such an efficient coding is achieved using a competition across neurons so as to generate a sparse representation, that is, where a relatively small number of neurons are simultaneously active. Indeed, different models of sparse coding, coupled with Hebbian learning and homeostasis, have been proposed that successfully match the observed emergent response. However, the specific role of homeostasis in learning such sparse representations is still largely unknown. By quantitatively assessing the efficiency of the neural representation during learning, we derive a cooperative homeostasis mechanism that optimally tunes the competition between neurons within the sparse coding algorithm. We apply this homeostasis while learning small patches taken from natural images and compare its efficiency with state-of-the-art algorithms. Results show that while different sparse coding algorithms give similar coding results, the homeostasis provides an optimal balance for the representation of natural images within the population of neurons. Competition in sparse coding is optimized when it is fair. By contributing to optimizing statistical competition across neurons, homeostasis is crucial in providing a more efficient solution to the emergence of independent components.},

@article{Geisler01,
	Abstract = {The human brain manages to correctly interpret almost every visual image it receives from the environment. Underlying this ability are contour grouping mechanisms that appropriately link local edge elements into global contours. Although a general view of how the brain achieves effective contour grouping has emerged, there have been a number of different specific proposals and few successes at quantitatively predicting performance. These previous proposals have been developed largely by intuition and computational trial and error. A more principled approach is to begin with an examination of the statistical properties of contours that exist in natural images, because it is these statistics that drove the evolution of the grouping mechanisms. Here we report measurements of both absolute and Bayesian edge co-occurrence statistics in natural images, as well as human performance for detecting natural-shaped contours in complex backgrounds. We find that contour detection performance is quantitatively predicted by a local grouping rule derived directly from the co-occurrence statistics, in combination with a very simple integration rule (a transitivity rule) that links the locally grouped contour elements into longer contours.},

@article{Olshausen96,
	Abstract = {The receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian primary visual cortex can be characterized as being spatially localized, oriented and bandpass (selective to structure at different spatial scales), comparable to the basis functions of wavelet transforms. One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs.},

@article{Smith06,
	Abstract = {The auditory neural code must serve a wide range of auditory tasks that require great sensitivity in time and frequency and be effective over the diverse array of sounds present in natural acoustic environments. It has been suggested that sensory systems might have evolved highly efficient coding strategies to maximize the information conveyed to the brain while minimizing the required energy and neural resources. Here we show that, for natural sounds, the complete acoustic waveform can be represented efficiently with a nonlinear model based on a population spike code. In this model, idealized spikes encode the precise temporal positions and magnitudes of underlying acoustic features. We find that when the features are optimized for coding either natural sounds or speech, they show striking similarities to time-domain cochlear filter estimates, have a frequency-bandwidth dependence similar to that of auditory nerve fibres, and yield significantly greater coding efficiency than conventional signal representations. These results indicate that the auditory code might approach an information theoretic optimum and that the acoustic structure of speech might be adapted to the coding capacity of the mammalian auditory system.},
